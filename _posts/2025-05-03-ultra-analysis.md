On March 29, 2025, I ran my first ultramarathon, a 50K race along Chicago’s scenic lakefront trail. It was my first time running further than the marathon distance, and my goal was simply to finish. The final 10 miles were especially tough, but I made it to the finish line!

Since I love digging into data, I naturally downloaded the official race results and registration data to explore who ran the race and how we all performed. I conducted the analysis in Python, using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. If you’re curious to see the code or run the notebook yourself, you can check it out on my GitHub (link).

This blog shares some of the insights I uncovered.
