My name is Chau, and I’m a freelance data consultant. Before starting my own business, I worked as a Product Manager at Toast and as a Business Analyst at Amazon. I love solving problems, making sense of messy data, and turning insights into clear, compelling stories. I have always been drawn to both data and design, and I’m especially excited by projects that let me combine analytical thinking with creativity to build solutions that are practical, intuitive, and empower users to find answers on their own.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and began my data career at Morningstar as a Data Analyst. That’s where I developed my technical foundation in SQL and Python and learned to approach analysis with a research mindset. I typically start with a hypothesis and let the data guide me from there. Over time, I shifted my focus to building dashboards that help business and product teams access their data and move faster. I’m experienced in tools like Tableau and Power BI, and I enjoy working with the people who use my dashboards just as much as building them. 

These days, I work with organizations, non-profits, and small businesses to help them use their data more strategically. I believe data holds the answers to big, important questions, but only when it’s framed within the right context. That’s why I begin every project by understanding the business goals and asking “why” before diving into the details. With nearly a decade of experience, I have learned to deliver insights that not only resonate with my audience, but also empower them to make confident, informed decisions.

When I’m not working, I enjoy running and baking. I like slow, long runs in zone 2, and the half marathon is one of my favorite distances to race. A few of my friends have told me that if I ever start a chocolate chip cookie subscription, they’d be the first to sign up.

Got a data challenge or an idea you want to bounce around? Let’s talk! I’m all ears.
